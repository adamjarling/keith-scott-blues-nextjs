          <strong>
            - Steve Sharp, contributing writer, Living Blues magazine
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Remarkably versatile, Chicago-based blues/rock guitarist Keith Scott
          has been working his way methodically up through the blues&quot; ranks
          since his parents bought him his first guitar at age 14 and his young
          ears heard Muddy Waters in 1980.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born in White Plains, N.Y., Scott was first exposed to the music of
          Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Grand Funk Railroad. With this sonic
          baptism, a mind-set and foundation were established for him to explore
          the realm of blues inhabited by the creme de la creme of Chicago
          musicians such as Waters, Howlin&quot; Wolf, Jimmy Reed and others in
          that pantheon. Little did Scott know, however, that he would go on in
          just a few years to actually play with many of the greats of post-war
          Chicago blues.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quot;I was totally blown away,&quot; Scott says of first hearing
          Waters, adding he was lucky enough to meet this master of the Chicago
          blues in 1980 while living in Florida. &quot;Meeting Muddy Waters
          really helped in spurring my interest in playing blues. My musician
          friend opened for Muddy on the campus of the University of Florida at
          Gainesville and he invited me to come and hang out with him.&quot;
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Scott remembers meeting Waters as being, &quot;overwhelming.&quot;
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quotHe was very cordial,&quot; Scott says of the elder statesman.
          &quotThen, I met his whole band and partied with them — guys like Matt
          Murphy and Lovie Lee, Ray Allison, all those guys. I didn&quot;t think
          I&quot;d be in a band until I met Muddy Waters and his band. Then I
          said, &quot;I want to be in a blues band.&quot; They were just so
          stately and well-dressed, and they took their music so seriously. They
          seemed like they were gentlemen and they loved what they did.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Around that time, Scott also met Bo Diddley, another encounter that
          had a profound effect on him.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quotI got to spend some time at Bo Diddley&quot;s house in
          Gainesville, Fla. That time, too, my friend was his bass player. Bo
          was awesome, totally the coolest guy. He cooked, he had a barbeque and
          I remember he had a lot of dogs,&quot; Scott says.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          As time passed and Scott became acquainted with the greats of blues
          through their records and performances as well as personally, the
          blues crept increasingly into his own guitar playing.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quotI thought I would learn to play blues, but I didn&quot;t really
          think I&quot;d get this proficient at it,&quot; Scott says.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          By 1982, as the love of the blues consumed him, Scott left Florida and
          moved to Chicago to become part of the mind-blowing scene the city
          offered in that era.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quotMy friend said, &quot;We&quot;ll move to Chicago, put a blues
          band together, play that scene and meet everybody,&quot; Scott
          recalls.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          They did just that, and for Scott, it worked better than he could have
          imagined. Not long after his arrival in Chicago, he was spending his
          nights at the city&quot;s greatest blues clubs, as well as some of its
          most obscure and down-home West Side haunts, meeting the best of the
          city&quot;s blues talent.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quotIt was pretty incredible,&quot; he says. &quotAfter I got there,
          the next thing I know I am at the Checkerboard Lounge and Buddy Guy
          was there, just hanging around. Junior Wells was there and everybody
          was real friendly — and it wasn&quot;t commercialized at all.&quot;
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          With his other blues hangouts being the famed Theresa&quot;s on the
          South Side, B.L.U.E.S. on Halsted and innumerable joints on the West
          Side, Scott&quot;s indoctrination into Windy City music progressed at
          lightning speed, with him meeting and playing behind legends such as
          Johnny Littlejohn, B.B. Odom, Eddie Taylor and Little Milton. These
          older gentlemen, Scott says, taught him the importance of &quotjust
          lying back and being a good accompaniest&quot; while serving as a
          backing musician. He recalls, also, he learned some practical lessons
          about dealing with the unpleasant, rougher edges of the Chicago blues
          world.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quotI played my first gig with Bill Warren, who drummed on Junior
          Wells&quot; &quot;Hoodoo Man Blues&quot; album,&quot; Scott recalls.
          &quotHe offered $30 for the gig. At the end of the night he gave each
          guy in the band $5. I said, &quot;Where&quot;s my $30?&quot; He said,
          &quot;I meant it&quot;s $30 for the band!’
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          As his playing skills and confidence grew, so did Scott&quot;s resume.
          He was noticed by Hip Linkchain, who asked him to join his band in
          1985 and Scott immediately traveled with Linkchain to Calgary,
          Alberta, Can. It wasn&quot;t long before sly businessman and wizard of
          the West Side blues guitar Jimmy Dawkins — a friend of
          Linkchain&quot;s — snapped up Scott for use in his own insanely heavy
          blues band. Scott&quot;s first gig with Dawkins occurred Oct. 24, 1986
          when they drove to Miami Fla. to play the Tobacco Road club. Under
          Dawkins, Scott cut his teeth further at a fast clip, touring the
          United States, Canada and Europe into the early 1990s.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          &quotMy fondest memories of playing with Jimmy are some of the crazy
          times in the van at night, driving through Canada and when Robert
          Plant came to watch us play at B.L.U.E.S. That night with Robert Plant
          was a highlight. He hung out with us,&quot; Scott says. For Scott,
          having Plant in the audience symbolized his life had perhaps come full
          circle — there was his boyhood rock idol, standing in one of
          Chicago&quot;s premier blues clubs, watching him play the music.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          As concerts with Dawkins became more sporadic in the 1990s and
          Scott&quot;s reputation as a reliable, controlled and soulful
          guitar-slinger grew, Scott ventured out on his own, performing a loud
          and funky brand of music he perfected, labeled and plays to this day
          called &quotheavy blues.&quot;
        </p>

        <p>
          Scott has seven solo CDs to his credit, among these, &quotHeavy
          Blues,&quot; &quotWorld Blues&quot; and &quotUniversal Blues.&quot;
          His &quotTennessee Blues,&quot; released in Fall of 2011, has been
          reviewed favorably by Living Blues, the world&quot;s premier blues
          magazine. He was also reunited onstage with Dawkins at the 2010
          Chicago Blues Festival in front of a crowd of thousands.
        </p>

        <p>
          Scott maintains an ambitious touring schedule in 2012 that has him
          driving hundreds of miles a week to perform as an acoustic, solo
          artist throughout Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin. He frequently
          makes treks to play clubs in the Pacific Northwest and Montana, while
          spending time in the summer working festivals with his electric band.
          Scott is also a favorite on college campuses and on Chicago&quot;s
          popular WXRT radio.

        <blockquote>
          &quotI guess it&quot;s the lifestyle I enjoy,&quot; he says of his
          hectic, itinerant way of living. &quotI get to meet new people, create
          a new progression in my career. I wait for the phone to ring — today
          it did. Whether it&quot;s the House of Blues or a small tavern,
          it&quot;s still what I love to do.&quot;
